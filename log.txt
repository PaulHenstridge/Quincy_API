to activte venv:
$ source venv/bin/activate

to deactivate venv:
$ deactivate

generate requirements file:
$ pip freeze > requirements.txt

run the app from quincy_api directory:
$ python3 -m root.app  
apparently necessary due to modules and relative paths,  not totally clear tbh.

for deployment: host DB on Atlas and link to hosted app.
Setting up MongoDB Atlas:

Sign up on MongoDB Atlas and create a new cluster.
Once the cluster is set up, you can get the connection string. This string is used by your application to connect to the MongoDB cluster.
Ensure that the IP whitelist (under the security settings of the cluster) allows connections from your Heroku app. You can, although not recommended for production apps, whitelist all IPs by setting it to 0.0.0.0/0.
Integrating with Heroku:

You can set the MongoDB Atlas connection string as a configuration variable on Heroku using the following command:

heroku config:set MONGODB_URI=your_connection_string
In your application, you'd retrieve this connection string using:

import os
MONGODB_URI = os.environ.get('MONGODB_URI')
Now, using this URI, your app can connect to MongoDB Atlas from Heroku.
